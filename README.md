Incredible Movies DavClauds

## What is this?

This app was made with the purpose of storing the time and location of the movies I watched with @ClaudiaRaquelGuedes. You can add movies, order them by preference, give them an emoji rating. Movies are added by searching the IMDB database for them, which means that the app can automatically retrieve any information about the movie. The list of movies displayed on the app is seamlessly synchronized with a remote server, so that when I make a change to the list, @ClaudiaRaquelGuedes sees the change on her app too. 

The server is running NodeJS + Express. It is very simple, only allows for two actions (get and set).

## How to Run

This repo is primarily intended to showcase the app, and since you don't have access to the server that can interoperate with the app (nor to the source code running on the server). In any case, should you want to build the app yourself, you can follow the instructions available [in the official documentation.](https://ionicframework.com/docs/building/running)
